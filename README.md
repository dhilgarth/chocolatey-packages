    - TechSmith SnagIt (snagit)
    - Util Linux getopt (getopt)

- Manual Packages
    - git-flow AVH Edition (gitflow-avh)

If you don't know Chocolatey, check it out on [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org)! It is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind.
