Chocolatey packages
=============

This repository hosts the code of the Chocolatey packages I am the maintainer of. These are:  

- Sysinternals Process Explorer (procexp)
- Sysinternals Process Monitor (procmon)

If you don't know Chocolatey, check it out on [chocolatey.org](http://chocolatey.org)! It is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind.
